# author-vectorization
vectorizing authors by writing style!


## How does it work?

The idea is to use elementary algorithms to vectorize text [src/AuthorVectorizer.java]. The vectorized text can then be used to compare the writing style of the author to other authors.

## How to use it?

### 1. Download the project

```
git clone //todo
```

### 2. Run the project

run main.java

### 3. Use the project

input the filename you want to vectorize
